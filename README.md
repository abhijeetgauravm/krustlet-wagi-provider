This is a [Krustlet](https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet) [Provider](https://docs.krustlet.dev/topics/architecture/#providers) implementation for the [WAGI](https://github.com/deislabs/wagi) runtime.

# Running the Demo

In a new terminal, start the WAGI provider:
```
$ just run
```

In another terminal:
```
$ kubectl apply -f demos/wagi/k8s.yaml
```

Once the pod is ready:
```
$ curl 127.0.0.1:3000/hello
